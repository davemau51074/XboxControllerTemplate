# XboxControllerTemplate
A template I made to read  inputs from an Xbox controller


If you have an Xbox 360 controller(or an Xbox One controller and a micro USB cable) that can connect to a laptop
just hook it straight in and run the application It will detect and button presses as inputs and display a corresponding 
output to the screen 
One or two slight bugs with the Dpad
